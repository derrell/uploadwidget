UploadForm and UploadFile Implementation.

The class UploadForm creates a hidden iframe which is used as a target for the 
form submit.

An event of type "sending" is fired after submit. On completion (iframe 
completed loading) a "completed" event is fired.

UploadForm implements the methods getIframeTextContent(), 
getIframeHtmlContent() and getIframeXmlContent() to get the content of the 
iframe.

UploadFile fires a "changeValue" event after the selection by the OS file 
selector is completed.

Multiple UploadFile instances are possible. The text field is read-only.
